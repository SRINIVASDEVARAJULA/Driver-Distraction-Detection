# Driver-Distraction-Detection
Our goal is to create a better accuracy model that can detect whether a driver is driving safely or distractedly. Photographs of the driver taken in the taxi serve as input for our model. We employ multiple SoftMax classifiers to predict the sort of distracted behaviour that drivers are participating in after preprocessing these photos to produce input vectors.
